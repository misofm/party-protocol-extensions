# Release Audit — `party_music`

**Repository:** `https://github.com/misofm/party-protocol-extensions`
**Audit target:** `main`
**Reviewed:** 2026-09-02 with `sui 1.78.1-722ac4fcf484`
**Verification re-run:** 2026-10-21 with `sui 1.82.1`, after the house-style pass

## Verdict

Release-ready. No security or correctness findings remain.

## Implementation reviewed

`party_music` is a pure payload package, not a state-attaching extension. It
defines eight artist-platform payload types and validated constructors for
Spotify, Bandcamp, SoundCloud, Apple Music, Deezer, Tidal, Amazon Music, and
Audiomack. A shared private validator enforces nonempty identifiers no longer
than 256 bytes. The package has no Party, cap, storage, event, or automation
logic; `party_platform_link` attaches returned values to Party state.

## Manifest dependencies

| Dependency | Kind | Location |
|---|---|---|
| `platform_link` | local-path | `../lib/platform_link` |

The manifest's only dependency is the local-path `platform_link` sibling
above (`platform_link = { local = "../lib/platform_link" }`); it carries no
Git pin and no floating dependency.

## Verification

- Package tests: **5/5**, including **3** expected-failure paths for empty
  Spotify, empty Bandcamp, and the shared overlength validator.
- All eight constructors and all eight accessors execute on success.
- Production instruction coverage: **100.00%**.
- Shared-Party workflow: not applicable; this package is pure payload code.
- Repository aggregate (re-run 2026-10-21): **146/146** tests across the 11
  packages with zero warnings, strict Mainnet and Testnet builds; all 11
  production modules at **100.00%**.

## Published metadata

The retained `Published.toml` is the sole record of the prior immutable Testnet package id;
it is not repeated here.
Its bytecode predates the pending validator refactor even though public behavior
and ABI are preserved. Fresh immutable publication uses the admin CLI with
`--allow-republish`; only after confirmed success may it replace the target
network block.
